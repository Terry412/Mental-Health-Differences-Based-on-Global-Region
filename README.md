# Mental-Health-Differences-Based-on-Global-Region

The purpose of this project is to examine mental health indicator differences (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress scores) based on the world region participants reside in. The project mainly consists of assessing mental health differences using One-Way Between subjects ANOVA, assessing ANOVA parametric assumptions, and conducting Kruskal-Wallis tests (i.e., the non-parametric version of One-Way Between subjects ANOVA) when parametric assumptions were found to be violated. The sample consists of 39775 participants. The dataset was derived from Open-Source Psychometrics Project
